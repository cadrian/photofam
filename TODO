- add an "all tags" tree and an "all dates" tree besides the "all albums" tree
- fix thumbnails preview (lots of bugs: no refresh, array index out of bounds...)
- fix the dates tree
- put image metadata in the XML file, for faster access when re-opening the album
- create a photofam-main module, move PhotoFam there and fix the dependencies:
   - all modules but photofam-main must depend only on slf4j (not on logback)
   - photofam-ui should depend on photofam-model, not on photofam-core
